# CSCI4448 Project Writeup

## Name: Kyle Helmick

## GitHub Link: github.com/Kyle-Helmick/csci4448-loop

## Title: Loop

## Project Summary

Loop is a fake social media platform for developers. Users sign up with Github and effectively have access to a twitter clone. They can edit their handle, location, and name and make posts to their "page". If the user chooses to, they can create a group that others can join and make posts into the group (everything is public just like twitter).

*Floating classes / classes that confict with the writeup requirements are configuration classes (and won't have connections if I include the UML diagrams of my dependencies), what I wrote (not to configure my project) has connections in the class diagram*
